# Blog Homepage Data Fetching and Async Performance Fix

## Task Overview
Utkrusht's content team relies on the blog homepage to showcase the latest posts and updates for users. However, the current homepage often displays 'undefined' for blog titles and descriptions due to improper data typing and asynchronous fetching issues. User reports point to slow loading and occasional missing posts. We want to ensure a reliable, performant homepage that fetches posts from an external API, correctly types all data, and handles loading or error states with good UX practices.

## Guidance
- Use Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript throughout the project.
- Implement client-side async data fetching for blog posts using async/await patterns.
- Define and use TypeScript interfaces for post data and asynchronous operations.
- Handle asynchronous fetches robustly: display loading and error states, prevent rendering before data is ready, and safeguard against race conditions or unneeded re-renders.
- Layout and styling can use Tailwind CSS.
- Make sure server-client coordination is clean: minimize data fetching and state issues that harm performance.

## Objectives
- Fetch and render a list of blog posts from a mock API endpoint using async/await and TypeScript interfaces.
- Handle loading and error states clearly in the UI.
- Eliminate 'undefined' values and ensure all required data is correctly typed and rendered.
- Avoid performance bottlenecks, e.g., unnecessary renders or data race conditions.

## How to Verify
- Loading the homepage shows a styled list of blog posts, with no missing or undefined values.
- Loading and error states are clearly shown until data is ready.
- Confirm with DevTools that data is fetched only as needed; rapid reloads should not cause flicker or duplicate requests.
- There are no TypeScript compile or type errors. All fetches, props, and data are properly typed and safe.
